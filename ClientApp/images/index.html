        <p>My name is Sean.  CodeMKE is my web development company.  I'm a software engineer during the day, and a crime fighter by night.  And by fighting crime, I mean making websites for small businesses.  I've worked in retail and the service industry my entire life, so I believe I bring some valuable insight into designing websites for other small businesses.  And I'm now a small business myself, so I know how important keeping costs low are for a small business.  While a web site is certainly a big investment, I hope to bring you the most economical approach.  So please feel free to contact me with any questions that you have, and hopefully I can help you on your path to establishing or upgrading your single most important marketing tool, your web site!</p>

			  <p>January 2015</p>
			  <p>After trying to learn iOS programming on and off for three years, I was lucky enough to find a website called <a href="http://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>.  I started taking an iOS programming course by Rob Percival, and was offered a link to his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/" target="_blank">web development course</a>.  I would highly recommend it if you are interested.  So far, I have honed the following skills, which you can see before you on this very page!</p>

			  <p>Starter September 2015.</p>
			  <p>After working at a great company with a terrible commute, I decided to move to a company a little closer to home.  I was nervous at first because it was with a lot of technology that was new to me, but now I am so happy that I've moved here.  Not only is it a great company, but I've helped expand my knowledge and continued to hone existing skills.</p>

			  <p>Finding an internship is an incredibly difficult task.  I was fortunate enough to get an internship with Quad Graphics doing Change Management.  This is another way to say updating documents and testing code.  This was a good job, and I was very good at it, but I had come so far to get a coding job, so when an opportunity came up, I had to move along.</p>

			  <p>Fast forward through three years of bar tending, which is essentially the only thing you can do to make money with an English degree if you don't want to teach, and I decided to go back to school. A turn of events brought me back to an old love, computer programming.</p>
			  <p>Also took five semesters of Japanese during this degree.  I was two classes shy of a Japanese minor, but I was lucky enough to get a job during my last semester, and had to drop those two classes.  Would love one day to pick up the language again.</p>
