      <h1 class="center">Welcome to CodeMKE</h1>
      <p class="lead center">My name is Sean, and I'm a Software Developer from Milwaukee.  I wanted to have a small corner of the web dedicated to the idea of sharing what I've learned as a Software Developer, both technical knowledge and personal experience.  So here are my goals for this site, and if you scroll down there is a little info about why you should listen to me.</p>

          <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>I have always liked coding, but I have come to learn in my career that web development is something that I find fun and exciting.  It is a perfect marriage of creativity and coding, and has the capability of easily reaching the biggest audience.  I started to learn a few basics of Java web development at my job, and then started taking extra classes to learn more in depth and varied topics.  And that's how this page came into existence.  To hone my skills, and challenge myself to learn, I am starting to do freelance web development.  The results are the portfolio I have developed here. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">

          <h2>Tutorials</h2>
          <p>If you are a software developer, you are intimately familiar with the site <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. That site is probably one of the most visited on my work computer.  But there is a lot of sifting that has to be done to find your answers sometimes.  I wanted to have a small space where I can post errors that I have run into, and the solutions that I have found, for anyone out there, and for myself for reference if I ever need it.</p>
          <p>That also goes for tutorials.  There are a lot of great tutorials out there on the web, so I don't plan on reinventing the wheel.  I'll post links to any great tutorials I find, but every once in a while, after the second step of the tutorial, you run into an error that the tutorial doesn't cover cause you are lost.  I plan on including any such missteps in my tutorials, so you don't have to bang your head against your desk for several hours.  I will have already done that for you.  As a resource, I would love for anyone reading this tutorials to contact me with any such circumstances, and we can update the tutorial to include these pitfalls.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">

          <h2>Blogs</h2>
          <p>I also wanted to capture my experience as a software developer, since, it hasn't been the most traditional course.  I want to talk about what it's like to interview for a job, what it's actually like when you start that job; stuff I feel like they don't always necessarily  prepare you for before stepping into the real world.  Maybe it will inspire you to take the step that you've always thought about.  Maybe it'll just give you a laugh from time to time.  </p>

          <p>After trying to learn iOS programming on and off for three years, I was lucky enough to find a website called <a href="http://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>.  I started taking an iOS programming course by Rob Percival, and was offered a link to his <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/" target="_blank">web development course</a>.  I would highly recommend it if you are interested.  So far, I have honed the following skills, which you can see before you on this very page!</p>

          <p>More than a decade later, through life's twists and turns, I finally ended up at the I was looking for so long ago.  And I love it.  And it was working here, with a very patient and intelligent Senior Software Engineer, that I learned to love web programming.</p>

          <p>Internship - May 2012 through December 2012</p>
          <p>Finding an internship is an incredibly difficult task.  I was fortunate enough to get an internship with Quad Graphics doing Change Management.  This is another way to say updating documents, and testing code.  This was a good job, and I was very good at it, but I had come so far to get a coding job, so when an opportunity came up, I had to move along.</p>

          <p>Attended September 2010 through December 2013</p>
          <p>Fast forward through three years of bar tending, which is essentially the only thing you can do to make money with an English degree if you don't want to teach, and I decided to go back to school to add a Journalism/Mass Communication degree to my collection.  I was taking a publication design class and halfway through the semester, we had to build a simple HTML website.  I finished the three hour assignment in fifteen minutes, walked out of that class to the engineering building, and changed my major to Computer Science that afternoon.  I had forgotten how much I really enjoyed writing code. </p>
          <p>Also took five semesters of Japanese during this degree.  I was two classes shy of a Japanese minor, but I was lucky enough to get a job during my last semester, and had to drop those two classes.  Would love one day to pick up the language again.</p>

          <p>After getting disillusioned by Physics of Thermodynamics and Electricity, I moved onto what would have been my second choice for a degree: Creative Writing.  I loved it.  I've always been an avid reader, and fell right into writing.  While I don't get to do it as much as I like, I've still got one story that's been brewing for years that will get out sooner or later.</p>

          <p>I took three years of computer programming in high school, and wanted to continue this into college.  Followed a friend to MSOE to get a degree in Software Engineering.  After two difficult years of engineering specific classes, got turned off to the idea of an engineering degree.  Transferred to UWM.</p>
